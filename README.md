Case Study Analysis with SQL & Tableau

Welcome to this repository! This project contains SQL queries and a Tableau dashboard used to analyze a case study involving customer, request, and contract data.


The goal of this case study is to explore, analyze, and visualize key insights from the following datasets:

Clientes – Customer information (e.g., ID, name, demographic data)

Solicitudes – Requests or applications made by customers (e.g., request ID, date, type)

Contratos – Contracts associated with customers (e.g., contract ID, start/end date, amount)

Using these tables, we answer specific business questions and create visual insights.
